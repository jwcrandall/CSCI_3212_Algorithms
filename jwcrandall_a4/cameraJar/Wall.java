/**
* Wall class defines a wall, either external surrounding a space, or internal
* separating the space. A Wall is defined by a line with start and end points.
*
* The line specified is taken to be the lower side of a horizontal wall or the
* left side of a vertical wall. This has the effect that for external walls,
* the top wall is specified as located at (0,hiboundY-1) to (hiboundX,hiboundY-1).
* Similarly the right external wall is (hiboundX-1,0) to (hiboundX-1,hiboundY).
*
* Walls have a thickness of one unit. So the lines defining the four sides of
* a wall can be generated from the single side.
*
* Lines must be horizontal or vertical. Diagonal or angled walls are not allowed.
*
* The start coordinates must be less than the end coordinates.
